Even after data modeling, query on huge data will be inefficient over time. To overcome that, we need to do data partitioning. 

Data Partioning:
	-> Improve query performance
	-> Data has been stored in multiple chunks, each chunk will have partition key via which query can quickly and easily be performed
	-> Most common partition key is datestamp(ds)

BackFilling Historical Data:
	-> represent a process of historical data
	Dynamic Partition:
		-> A construct that used to perform same SQL operations over many partitions and perform multiple inserations at once.
		-> Hive provides such functionality
